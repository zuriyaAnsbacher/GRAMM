there are 6 python scripts in graph_generator

wmda_to_hpf_csv.py - convert wmda frequencies to hpf (GRIMM)
generate_neo4j_wmda_hpf.py - genreate graph csvs  (GRIMM)
nemo_to_hpf_csv.py - convert nemo frequencies to hpf
generate_Neo4J_multi.py - create mutli graph from frequencies files
** generate_neo4j_hpf.py - same but reads hpf file
generate_neo4J_load_files.py - early code based on jupyter notebook



I used this one (**) as the single method to rule them all.
It generate multiple CP links between nodes (with different values).
This makes the graph traversal ambiguous.
Not good.
