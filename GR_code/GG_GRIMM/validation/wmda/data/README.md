## Reproducing the WMDA MVT 3 Consensus Results

The don.gl.txt_mvt-3-discrepancy.diff file illustrates a small but
technically incorrect modification to don.gl.txt.

The modification, adding A\*33:03 to the slash-delimited list of
possible A\*33 alleles for donor D004016, enables generation of
results identical to those in the set3.consensus.txt consensus
result file for WMDA matching validation task 3 (MVT 3).

For additional details about MVT 3, see the following article:
